To interact with an insecure repo, the first thing is to configure the Docker daemon in your machine to accept working with HTTP instead of HTTPS.

Edit the file /etc/docker/daemon.json, or create it if it doesn't exist, and add the following lines:


{
  "insecure-registries": [
    "your-repo:5000",
    "your-repo:5001"
  ],
  "disable-legacy-registry": true
}

You have to restart the daemon after setting this (sudo systemctl restart docker).
